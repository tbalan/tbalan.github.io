<h3 id="what-are-frailty-models">What are frailty models?</h3>

<p>Imagine we have a device that ticks every now and then, and denote the number of ticks up to time $t$ as
$N(t)$. Broadly speaking, the goal of survival analysis is to determine the <em>intensity</em> of this process,
so as to answer how likely it is that, after observing this device for a while, we would expect another
tick to happen in the next period of time.</p>

<p>This quantity is usually modeled like:
$$
h(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta^\top \mathbf{x}(t))
$$
where $h_0(t)$ is a <em>baseline</em> intensity and $\mathbf{x}(t)$ represents a number of possibly time dependent factors,
or knowledge that we have about $N(t)$, that we believe it might influence the intensity. This is called a
<em>proportional intensity</em> model and has been developed from the 70s.
The term <em>survival analysis</em> comes from the situation where $N$ can only click once, usually representing death.</p>

<p>Frailty models come in for two big reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>usually we do not know <em>all</em> the factors that may influence $h(t)$.</li>
<li>when several devices are related in a way that is difficult to quantify (thinking similar unmeasured genetic build or similar environmental conditions that can&rsquo;t be measured), we know that the tickers are related, and this information must be incorporated somehow</li>
</ul>

<p>So in essence we claim that there is an unobservable variable $Z$ that affects $h(t)$. If we had observed $Z$ (which we don&rsquo;t), then the intensity of $N(t)$ would be
$$
h(t) = Z h_0(t) \exp(\beta^\top \mathbf{x}(t)).
$$</p>

<p>We can work out that this is essentially a linear random intercept mixed model for the log-intensity. It turns out that, compared to regular linear mixed models, this leads to a large number of surprising results, while the estimation is in general challenging.</p>

<p>This type of models is still controversial to some extent, as they do involve a healthy dose of speculation. However, often, we are interested in the <em>conditional</em> treatment effect rather than the <em>marginal</em>, that is, the effect on the individual and not that on the population.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-my-phd">What is the purpose of my PhD?</h3>

<p>The aim of my PhD is to study how these things relate in the real world.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6913/full" target="_blank">Score test for association between recurrent events and a terminal event</a>, we developed, well&hellip; a score test to see whether a recurrent event process and a terminal event process are associated or not. The same idea can be used to test for dependent censoring of a recurrent event process. This is partially implemented in the <code>frailtyEM</code> package.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6968/full" target="_blank">Ascertainment correction in frailty models for recurrent events data</a>, we looked at what happens when you select individual histories of recurrent events based on a number of events having happened in a certain calendar time period. We propose a fix for that and an iterative estimation method.</li>
<li>In the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frailtyEM" target="_blank">frailtyEM: An R Package for Estimating Semiparametric Shared Frailty Models</a>, we implemented a general estimation method for semi-parametric frailty models. It&rsquo;s the only package (to my knowledge) that estimates gamma, positive stable, inverse Gaussian and a number of other distributions for the random effect, for semi-parametric shared frailty models. The original motivation was to have an R package that does things in a consistent way and is well documented, and many other ideas transformed it into what it is. For example, you can get a predicted survival curve with the frailty integrated out for an individual with time-dependent covariates.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also working on a number of other projects that will make it into this list as they get closer to completion.</p>
