      <description>frailtyEM is an R package that may be used for fitting shared frailty models. For a Breslow-type non-parametric baseline hazard, several frailty distributions are supported: gamma, inverse Gaussian, positive stable, PVF-family. Both clustered failures and recurrent events are supported, and prediction curves are easily obtained.
The stable version is on CRAN and development version on GitHub. For a more detailed presentation of models and methods, as well as an overview of the implemented estimation approach, I wrote a comprehensive vignette for the package.</description>

      <description>What are frailty models? Imagine we have a device that ticks every now and then, and denote the number of ticks up to time $t$ as $N(t)$. Broadly speaking, the goal of survival analysis is to determine the intensity of this process, so as to answer how likely it is that, after observing this device for a while, we would expect another tick to happen in the next period of time.</description>
